# On the sufficient condition for solving the Gap-filling problem using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

[Paper link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9415465)

This repository contains the code to reproduce the experiments.

## Dependencies

All necessary requirements are stated in `environment.yml` and may be installed using conda.
For example, to create a new environment and install the requirements:

```bash
$ conda env create --name dcnn-gap-filling --file environment.yml
```

## Dataset

The tessellation script can be found in `tessellation-generator/tessellator.py`.
The parameters for the datasets can be found at `tessellations_test/params.json` and `tessellations_train/params.json`.
The datasets can be (re-)generated by running the script `./generate_datasets.sh`.

An additional script to view some general statistics about the generated datasets can be found in `analyze_tessellations`.

The muscle fibre dataset can be downloaded at https://github.com/AnikaNovikov/SLCV.

## Library

Code which is reused by the experiments is in the folder `unet`.

The implementation is adapted from https://github.com/jvanvugt/pytorch-unet.
